# GravitonRqlParserBundle
Symfony 2 bundle to the graviton/php-rql-parser.

This package adheres to [SemVer](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) versioning.

It uses a github version of [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) in which new features and bugfixes must be merged to develop
using a github pull request. It uses the standard git-flow naming conventions with the addition of a 'v' prefix to version tags.

Since the underlying library is under heavy development, this bundle is considered unstable, too.
Please refer to the [library](https://github.com/libgraviton/php-rql-parser) for more information about the [current state](https://github.com/libgraviton/php-rql-parser#current-state).

## Installation
